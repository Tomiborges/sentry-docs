Install the package via the [Unity Package Manager using a Git URL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) to Sentry's SDK repository:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/unity.git
```

If you want to use a specific version of the SDK, you can append `#{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.unity', '0.0.5') }}` with the version you want to use to the URL.

<Alert>

Confirm the URL doesn't have a trailing whitespace at the end. The Unity Package Manager will fail to find the package if a trailing whitespace is appended.

</Alert>
